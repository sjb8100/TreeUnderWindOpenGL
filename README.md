# A terrain generator built with C# and the OpenTK bindings to OpenGL.

This was just a toy project I worked on for about a week while I was learning OpenGL. You can see my progress in the progression of screenshots below:

### 1. Got everything up and running (Nov. 21 2013)

### 2. 3D camera and grid for terrain (Nov. 23 2013)

### 3. Heightmap for terrain (Nov. 23 2013)

### 4. Heads up display with debugging info (Nov. 23 2013)

### 5. Triangles are colored based on elevation and steepness (Nov. 23 2013)

### 6. Slightly more interesting variation on terrain generation (Nov. 23 2013)

### 7. Per vertex coloring with smooth blending between colors (Nov. 24 2013)

### 8. Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs), view frustum culling, terrain split into pages using simple quadtree data structure (Nov. 25 2013)

### 9. First attempt at lighting with flat triangle shading (Nov. 25 2013)

### 10. Generated normal maps for more natural lighting (Nov. 25 2013)

### 11. Blended textures in Frame Buffer Object (technique is called texture splatting) (Nov. 26 2013)

### 12. Added a simple skybox that rotates slowly to give the illusion of moving clouds (Nov. 27 2013)

### 13. Random terrain generated with perlin noise. Added sand and water textures. Added fog. (Nov. 28 2013)
